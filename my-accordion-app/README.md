## My Accordion app

My Accordion app has been created as part of a job application for Unshackled Commerce Technology \

## How to run the the project\

To run the project, you need to run ng serve from within a terminal which will run . On the loaded page, you will see my running accordion application. \

## Accordion

Multiple expansion-panels can be combined into an accordion. The multi="true" input allows the expansions state to be set independently of each other. When multi="false" (default) just one panel can be expanded at a given time:

## Building the project

To build the project, I used the mat-expansion-panelheader code to produce the accordion. I found it to be successful and worked very well to produce the content I needed. The mat-expansion-panel-header shows a summary of the panel content and acts as the control for expanding and collapsing. This header may optionally contain an mat-panel-title and an mat-panel-description, which format the content of the header to align with Material Design specifications.

## Design Features

For styling, I used the BEM scss styling to create the design layout displayed on screen. It keeps design minimal and specific. It allows me to create child elements on a level design system. \

Using a the following colours, I produced a nicely styled accordion application which can be used in other projects going forward.

The following colours were used:

Accordion header colour: background: #33ccff;
Accordion body color: white;
Text hover effect within the accordion panel: color: #008080;

## Testing the project

Producing the accordion, I tested each panel as I added them. Once I had the first one created, I was then able to copy and paste the other and test each section as I added them.

One panel added and display \

The testing process I used was done step by step. Once I knew the second panel worked, I was able to copy and add 2 more panels. I then wrote brief text telling the story as to why I'm applying for the role and for which company. \
